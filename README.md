# Greek Business Income Calculator

## Overview
This project is a web-based calculator that helps estimate the gross income needed for different types of Greek businesses (ΑΤΟΜΙΚΗ, ΟΕ -ΕΕ, and ΙΚΕ) based on a desired take-home income. It takes into account various factors such as taxes, social security contributions, and other business-related expenses.

## Features

- Adjust calculation based on company age (first 5 years or after)
- Customize monthly accounting support costs for each business type
- Select calculation period from 1 to 12 months
- Detailed breakdown of taxes and expenses
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS

## How it Works

2. They can adjust monthly accounting support costs for each business type
3. Users select whether the company is in its first 5 years or not
